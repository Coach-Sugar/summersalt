- I was running a little long trying to complete this exercise so I will give you the script I was able to complete within an hour. 
- You can get a good idea of what my approach would be for the rest of the columns

Followup questions:
1. Depends on the how the data is sourced. In this case it is most likely survey data, so I would have the data updated similarily to how often the information is surveyed. With a lot of this data being about graduations it doesn't make sense to refresh the data a lot since it will realistically only change about 3 times per year.
2. I'm not sure I understand the question.
3. To simply check if we have duplicates:

SELECT unique_ident, COUNT(unique_ident)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY unique_ident
HAVING COUNT(unique_ident)>1

4. I am not sure.
